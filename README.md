# Portfolio

Personal portfolio site built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Setup

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in PUBLIC_CARTO_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

The interactive map uses [CARTO basemaps](https://carto.com/basemaps), which require an API key (free at [carto.com/basemaps/apikey](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey)). Set `PUBLIC_CARTO_API_KEY` locally in `.env` and in your hosting provider's environment variables; without it the map tiles show an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark.

## Adding Content

All content is stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `src/content/`. Create a new `.md` file in the relevant folder — the site will automatically pick it up.

Use the `order` field to control display order (lower = appears first).
